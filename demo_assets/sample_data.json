      "response": "I can see your energy usage was elevated yesterday, particularly around 2:30 PM when there was a significant power spike to 3,500W (normally around 1,200W). This appears to be caused by your main electrical panel. The spike lasted about 30 minutes and could indicate a malfunctioning appliance or equipment issue. I recommend checking your major appliances, especially any that were running during that time period.",

Your current peak usage is between 1-3 PM, so avoiding that time period will help reduce costs. I also notice your energy rates are typically lower during off-peak hours.",

      "response": "The energy spike at 2:30 PM was detected in your main electrical panel, reaching 3,500W compared to your normal 1,200W baseline. This represents a 192% increase in power consumption. The most likely causes are: 1) A malfunctioning appliance that suddenly drew excessive power, 2) Multiple high-energy devices running simultaneously, or 3) A short circuit or electrical issue. I recommend checking your HVAC system first, as it was running during that time and is your highest energy consumer.",
